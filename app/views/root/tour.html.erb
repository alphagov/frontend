        <h2>Starting with search</h2>

And we always show you where you are, so you can quickly explore a category.</p>

        <p>Neil: Central government in the UK is made up of around 400 organisations.</p>
        <p>Lauren: Each of these have websites where they publish information about who they are and what they do.</p>
        <p>N: We're bringing all of these websites together onto a single place on GOV.UK.</p>
        <p>L: Some have already moved, more will be joining soon.</p>
        <p>N: When we've finished, you won't need to know which bit of government does what in order to find out what government is doing on any given subject.</p>
        <p>L: Announcements, publications and policies will all be together in one place.</p>
        <p>N: You can still look up information about a specific government organisation, like the Ministry of Defence or the Department of Education, and see everything it's working on.</p>
        <p>L: Or you'll be able to see things from lots of organisations, gathered together around topics. Like everything on climate change or everything related to crime and justice.</p>
        <p>N: Inside government makes it simpler, clearer and faster to find out how government works, see who is working on what and stay updated when things change. See for yourself at <a href="/government">www.gov.uk/government</a>.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/#departments-and-policy">government section</a> of GOV.UK (formerly called &ldquo;Inside Government&rdquo;) makes it simpler, clearer and faster to explore how government works, see who is working on what and stay updated when things change.</p>
    <p>You can read more about the site below, or get started now by searching for things like departments, ministers, and policies.</p>

        <h2>Everything in one place</h2>
        <p>From November 2012, the websites of central government departments and other organisations start moving to GOV.UK. When completed, you’ll be able to find everything you need from government in one place.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Grouped by organisation...</h2>
        <p>Each department will have their own home on GOV.UK. They’ll be simple to navigate, with dedicated spaces for announcements, publications and policies.</p>
        
      </li>
      <li class="last">
        <h2>...and by topic</h2>
        <p>You don’t have to be an expert on how the government works to get around. Explore subjects by topic, like transport or housing, and see different policies on that subject from across government - all in one place.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Clear, easy-to-read formats</h2>
        <p>Each page has been designed so you can make the most of the information on it. That means there’s no clutter, and important information is clearly highlighted.</p>
        
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Written for everyone</h2>
        <p>Like the rest of GOV.UK, information about government policy will be clearly written and free of jargon, so anyone with an interest in what government is doing will be able to understand it.</p>
        
      </li>
      <li class="last">
        <h2>It’s not finished yet</h2>
        <p>Central government organisations will be moving over to GOV.UK until 2014, so you won’t find everything here right away. You can find out more about our team’s progress <a href="http://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/" rel="external">on their blog</a>.</p>
