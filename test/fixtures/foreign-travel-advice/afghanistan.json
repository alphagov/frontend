For further information contact the Embassy of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://afghanistanembassy.org.uk/\">Islamic Republic of Afghanistan</a> in London. </p>\n\n<h3>Passport validity</h3>\n\n<p>Your passport should be valid for a minimum period of 6 months from the date of entry into Afghanistan.</p>\n\n<h3>UK Emergency Travel Documents</h3>\n\n<p>UK Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Afghanistan. However, ETDs are accepted for exit from Afghanistan. </p>\n\n<h3>Yellow fever</h3>\n\n<p>Yellow Fever vaccination is required for travellers arriving from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.who.int/ith/chapters/ith2012en_annexes.pdf\" title=\"WHO Yellow Fever Country Regulations\">countries with risk</a> of yellow fever transmission. </p>\n\n<h3>Travelling with children</h3>\n\n<p>If you are travelling alone with a child you may need to produce documentary evidence of parental responsibility. The FCO does not allow staff based in Afghanistan to travel with their partners or children. For further information on exactly what is required at immigration contact the Embassy of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://afghanistanembassy.org.uk/\">Islamic Republic of Afghanistan</a> in London.</p>\n"

Terrorists and insurgents conduct frequent and widespread lethal attacks against British and coalition armed forces, political and civilian targets, and those working in the humanitarian and reconstruction fields. </p>\n\n<p>Attacks include bombs (roadside and other), suicide bombs (either on foot or by vehicle), indirect fire (rockets and mortars), direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades), kidnappings and violent crime.</p>\n\n<p>There are large amounts of unexploded bombs and land mines (both anti-tank and anti-personnel) throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p>You should be particularly vigilant in and around landmark locations and places where large public crowds can gather. Hotels used by the government of Afghanistan and western nationals, ministries, military establishments and religious sites have been attacked and further attacks are possible. Avoid regular visits to public places frequented by foreigners, including hotels, restaurants, shops and market places, especially at times of day when they are particularly busy and congested. The British Embassy does not allow official visitors to stay in any hotel overnight, and has placed less well protected restaurants off limits to staff. </p>\n\n<p>Further attacks are likely along the Jalalabad Road, the Airport Road, the Wardak road and near to Kabul airport. Take great care if you intend to use the Jalalabad and Airport roads. Avoid travelling at night and between the hours of 07:00 and 09:00 if possible.</p>\n\n<h3>Kidnap</h3>\n\n<p>The risk of being kidnapped throughout Afghanistan remains a constant threat. You should take the utmost care, vary routines and avoid setting regular patterns of movement. You should take professional security advice while in the country. Outside Kabul you should consider the use of permanent armed protection and armoured vehicles. Previous kidnaps involving British nationals have occurred in Badakhshan, Kunar, Kunduz and near the border with Pakistan. </p>\n\n<p>The long-standing policy of the British government is not to make substantive concessions to hostage-takers. The British government considers that paying ransoms and releasing prisoners increases the risk of further hostage taking.</p>\n"
