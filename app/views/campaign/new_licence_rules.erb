      <h2></h2>

      <p>New rules affecting drivers in Great Britain will be introduced from 19 January 2013. They include changes to what you can drive, the minimum age from which some vehicles can be driven, and driving licence card validity periods for some driver groups.</p> 

	  <p>At the same time DVLA will introduce a new style driving licence.</p> 

	  <p>Existing drivers - the new rules will not take away your entitlement to drive if it was granted before 19 January 2013. However, some of the new rules will affect you.</p> 

	  <p>New drivers from 19 January 2013 - if you apply for provisional entitlement to drive, or pass a driving test from 19 January 2013, the new rules will apply to you.</p>
