      <h2>Workplace pensions &mdash; what it means for you</h2>
      <p>Starting from October 2012, millions of workers will be enrolled into a workplace pension by their employer.
        If you’re enrolled, you, your employer and the government will pay into it. </p>

      <p>This is to make it easier for you to start saving, and to help you have more to live on in later life than
        just your State Pension. Larger employers are enrolling their workers first. </p>

      <p>You can opt out if you want to, but if you stay in you’ll have your own pension which you get when you retire.</p>

      <p>Want to know more? <a href="http://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions">Read our guide to workplace pensions</a>.<br />
