        <p>We sometimes place small data files on your computer. These are known as cookies. Most
        websites do this.</p>

        <p>They improve things by:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>remembering settings, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you visit a new page</li>
          <li>remembering information you’ve given (eg your postcode) so you don’t need to keep entering it</li>
          <li>measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets your needs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our cookies aren’t used to identify you personally. They’re just here to make the site work better
          for you. Indeed, you can manage and/or delete these small files as you wish.</p>

        <p>To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit <a rel="external" href="http://www.AboutCookies.org">AboutCookies</a>.org.

        <h2>How we use cookies</h2>

        <p>GOV.UK uses cookies in several places – we’ve listed each of them below with more details
          about why we use them and how long they will last.</p>

        <p>In most cases, we will let you know <strong>before</strong> we store
          a cookie on your computer by providing a message similar to this:
          <span class="sets-cookie"><a href="#" title="This link is an example that doesn’t do anything">sets a cookie</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 id="analyticscookies">Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h2>

        <p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to
          make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better.</p>

        <p>Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site,
          how you got here and what you click on. We do not collect or store your personal information
          (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are. We do
          not allow Google to use or share our analytics data.</p>

        <p>The following cookies are set by Google Analytics:</p>

        <p>Some pages on this site provide you with information based on your
        location. So when you enter your postcode, we save your approximate
        location to a cookie. This means you don’t have to keep typing your
        postcode in, and means we’ll always point you towards services that are
        closest to you e.g. the nearest
        <a href="/ukonline-centre-internet-access-computer-training" title="find UK online centres near you">UK online centre</a>.</p>
