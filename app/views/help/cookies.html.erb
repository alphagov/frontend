        <h2>Cookies</h2>

        <p>To make this site simpler, we sometimes place small data files on
        your computer. These are known as cookies. Most big websites do this
        too.</p>

        <p>They improve things by:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>remembering settings, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them
          whenever you visit a new page</li>
          <li>remembering information you’ve given (eg your postcode) so you
          don’t need to keep entering it</li>
          <li>measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets
          your needs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our cookies aren’t used to identify you personally. They’re just
        here to make the site work better for you. Indeed, you can manage
        and/or delete these small files as you wish.</p>

        <p>To learn more about cookies and how to manage them, visit
        <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" title="Information about cookies">AboutCookies.org</a>.
        Or please read on to find out more about how and where we use
        cookies.</p>

        <h3>How we use cookies</h3>

        <p>GOV.UK uses cookies in several places – we’ve listed each of them
        below with more details about why we use them and how long they will
        last.</p>

        <p>In most cases, we will let you know <strong>before</strong> we store
        a cookie on your computer by providing an icon similar to this:
        <span class="sets-cookie"><a href="#" title="This link is an example that doesn’t do anything">sets a cookie</a>.</span></p>

        <h3 id="analyticscookies">Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>

        <p>We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use
        this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to
        understand how we could do it better.</p>

        <p>Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how
        long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. We do
        not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or
        address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.  We
        do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data.</p>

        <p>The following cookies are set by Google Analytics:</p>

        <h3 id="locationcookies">Storing your approximate location</h3>

        <p>Some pages on this site provide you with information based on your
        location. So when you enter your postcode, we save your approximate
        location to a cookie. This means you don’t have to keep typing your
        postcode in, and means we’ll always point you towards services that are
        closest to you e.g. the nearest
        <a href="/uk-online-centre-internet-access-computer-training" title="find UK online centres near you">UK online centre</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="tourcookies">Remembering if you’ve seen our introductory message</h3>

        <p>On your first visit to parts of GOV.UK, you’ll be greeted by a pop-up
        message, welcoming you and providing background to this trial site.
        When you close the message, we’ll store a cookie so that your computer
        knows you’ve seen it and knows not to show it again (and again...).</p>
