        <p>The most common reason that pages appear to be broken is that the URL has been mistyped, either by hand or in a link. </p>

        <p>If you've checked that the link is spelled correctly and the page still isn't working then contact us, and use the form to tell us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the address of the page you were visiting</li>
          <li>the information you were expecting to see</li>
          <li>any information contained in the error message you are seeing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the link you were trying to follow came from GOV.UK then please also tell us</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the page the broken link is on</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="how-do-i-report-errors">How do I report errors I have found on your website?</h2>
        <p>At the bottom of each page on GOV.UK you can report a problem; if you've found errors (including typos, bugs, or badly formatted pages) then use that link to send us a quick note and we'll investigate that as soon as possible.</p>
