        <p>Please remember, this is a test ‘beta’ website. It may contain
        inaccuracies or be misleading. <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk">Directgov</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/">Businesslink</a>, and the 
        <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/list-government-departments-and-ministers">relevant 
        departmental or agency websites</a> remain the official sites for government information and services.</p>

        <p>If you’re stuck, try typing what you’re looking for in the search
        box in the top right hand corner of every page, then press return and
        you’ll be offered a list of content that we think is relevant to your
        search. You can also browse by sections <a href="/">from the main homepage</a>.

        <p>Since this is a beta site it’s entirely possible that we don’t yet
        have the information you’re searching for. There’s more on
        <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">our blog</a>
        about what we’ve covered so far and what’s still to come.</p>

        <p><a href="/help/accessibility">If you need specific help with
        accessibility or using the internet, there is a page here that may be
        useful</a>.</p>

        <p>And, if you have had trouble using the site we’d love
        <a href="/feedback">your feedback</a> on what you found difficult. This
        will help us make things better in the future.</p>
