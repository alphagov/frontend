        <p>The 'My Business' service run by Business Link was shut down on 17 October 2012, when GOV.UK replaced that site as the home of business services and information from the UK government.</p>
        <p>You won't be able to access any of the information once held in this account; it has been securely deleted and none of that information has been retained by the government.</p>
