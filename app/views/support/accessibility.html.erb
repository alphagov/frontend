        <p>We&rsquo;re working hard to make GOV.UK as accessible and usable as we can for everyone.</p>

        <p>
          The website does not include a separate accessibility statement. The <abbr title="Government Digital Service">GDS</abbr> team is not comfortable with a statement that draws a distinction between accessibility and any other aspect of best practice development.
        </p>

        <p>
          GOV.UK should be usable by recent versions of Jaws, NVDA, VoiceOver, Window Eyes and Supernova screen readers, ZoomText, Magic, Supernova and basic operating system screen magnifiers, as well as speech recognition software including Dragon Naturally Speaking, and native operating system speech packages.
        </p>
