      <p>Millions of workers are being automatically enrolled into a workplace pension by their employer. Once you’re enrolled, not only will you pay in to it but so will your boss and the government.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
        <p>John puts in £40, his employer puts in £30, the government adds £10 tax relief.</p>
        <p>A total of £80 will be paid into John's pension.</p>
      </div>
      <p>This is to make it easier for you to start saving. You can opt out if you want to, but that means losing out on employer and government contributions – and if you stay in you’ll have your own pension that you get when you retire.</p>

      <p>Every employer must automatically enrol workers into a workplace pension scheme who:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>are not already in one</li>
        <li>are aged between 22 and State Pension age</li>
        <li>earn more than £9,440 a year</li>
        <li>work in the UK</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Use our interactive tool to find out <a href="/auto-enrolled-into-workplace-pension">when you will be enrolled</a>.</p>

      <p>If you’re an employer, you need to act now to prepare. <a href="http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/automatic-enrolment.aspx?ns_campaign=063ecrDWPemployers2013&amp;ns_mchannel=GovReferral&amp;ns_source=Gov&amp;ns_linkname=EmployerReferralGov&amp;ns_fee=0" rel="external">Visit The Pensions Regulator website</a>.</p>
