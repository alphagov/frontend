        We do not allow Google to use or share the data about how you use this site.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics sets cookies that store anonymised information about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>how you got to the site</li>
          <li>the pages you visit on GOV.UK and government digital services, and how long you spend on each page</li>
          <li>what you click on while you're visiting the site</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We sometimes try out different versions of pages to see which work better for users (‘multivariate testing’).
          We'll save a cookie so that you consistently see the same version when browsing GOV.UK.
          The cookie name will change but will be in the form 'ABTest-[Test name]' where the 'Test name' describes which part of GOV.UK is being tested.
          This type of cookie will usually expire after between 1 and 4 weeks, but this may be longer for more in-depth tests.
